# TipCalculator
This appliation calculates the amount of tip to be payed on a bill. It considers the percentage of the bill the people want to pay as a bill.

It also allows for splitting of bill and tip between multiple people too if there is more than one person at a meal.

It also has some presets for the amount of tip one might want to pay.

In the future there will be multiple currencies if the user wants to pay in a currency different than what was entered. This will be done using an open API that gives the exchange rates.
